- 👋 Greetings! You can call me Farhan or Sappe - that's what my friends usually go with.
- 💻 I'm deeply intrigued by the art of web development. My journey began with languages like C, and now I'm immersing myself in the realms of JavaScript, experimenting with the likes of ReactJS, Next.js, and more to come (trust me, it's a rollercoaster of learning! 🎢).
- 🎓 I'm currently a dedicated student at Hasanuddin University, where I'm not just studying, but actively crafting my skills in the world of web development.
- 📬 Don't hesitate to reach out! Whether it's a chat about web development, tech in general, or just to connect, you can catch me at sappewaliaf21d@student.unhas.ac.id or drop a message at andifarhansappewali407@gmail.com.
